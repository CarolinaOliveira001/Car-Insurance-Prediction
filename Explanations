This website helped me configure the python in R.

The aim is to predict the outcome column. It is a binary classification.

After plot the distribution of the SPEEDING_VIOLATIONS, DUIS and PAST_ACCIDENTS, it looks like they follow a power law distribution.

Plots:
- density distributions about credit_score and a boxplot
- density + barplot about annual_mileage with the group outcome
- minority vs outcome 
- correlation
- boxplot of credit score vs income
